My Work:

I created a shopping app prototype called Vision Cart, integrating AR/VR for an immersive shopping experience. Vision Cart – AR/VR Shopping Experience
Overview
Vision Cart is an innovative shopping app that integrates Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) to provide users with an immersive and interactive shopping experience. The app allows users to virtually try on outfits, explore products in a 3D environment, and personalize their looks before making a purchase. The app includes features such as:
    •	Opening Page: Displays the Vision Cart logo and tagline.
    •	Sign-in Page: Allows users to sign in via Apple, Google, or Facebook or enter their email to continue. A "Create Account" option is also available.
    •	Home Page: Features a search bar (with a camera icon for virtual shopping), top-selling items, and a banner prompting users to try virtual shopping. The bottom navigation includes Home, Menu, Cart, Wishlist, and Profile buttons.
    •	Virtual Store Page: Users can choose between three options:
            1.	Open Camera - Try on items in real time.
            2.	Upload Image - See how clothes look on their uploaded image.
            3.	Create Look - Customize a 3D mannequin with different outfits.
    •	Your Look AR Page: Users can style the 3D figure by selecting shirts, trousers, jeans, and jackets.
